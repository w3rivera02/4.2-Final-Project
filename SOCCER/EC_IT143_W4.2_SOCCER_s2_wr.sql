-- Which countries have won the UEFA Euro?

-- I’m currently working on answering the question:
-- Which countries have won the UEFA Euro?* I’ve found that the euro_summary table contains a winner column 
-- that lists the champion of each tournament year. The next logical step is to select the distinct values from 
-- this column to avoid duplicates and sort them alphabetically. I’m using basic SQL techniques 
-- like SELECT DISTINCT and ORDER BY to keep the results clean and readable, 
-- and I’ve confirmed that each row in the table likely represents a unique tournament year.
